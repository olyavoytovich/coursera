                Ask any non-vegetarian, and they'll tell you how much
                they depend on chicken. Chicken, the most common type
                of poultry in the world, is so popular for good reason.

                Eating protein every day is important, our bodies need it.
                Proteins supply the building blocks our bodies need
                (called amino acids) that help us repair and build muscle,
                bone, skin, hair, cartilage, and more. Daily protein also helps our
                bodies main our lean body mass, also known as muscle mass.

                rice, raw or cooked fish, vegetables, and other ingredients.
                Sushi started as a way of preserving fish in seventh-century
                Japan, but has since evolved to describe a variety of food items.
